Build Status (Travis CI)
<https://travis-ci.org/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb> Package Info
(npm) <https://www.npmjs.org/package/webvr-polyfill-dpdb>

This is a fork of the online cache
<https://storage.googleapis.com/cardboard-dpdb/dpdb.json> of the *Device
Parameter Database (DPDB)* for the webvr-polyfill
<https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill>.


    <#adding-a-device>Adding a Device

You'll need to update |dpdb-formatted.json| with your device's
information in the following format:

{
  "devices": [
    {
      "type": "android",
      "rules": [
        {
          "mdmh": "asus/*/ASUS_Z00AD/*"
        },
        {
          "ua": "ASUS_Z00AD"
        }
      ],
      "dpi": [
        403,
        404.6
      ],
      "bw": 3,
      "ac": 1000
    }
  ]
}

  * |type|: Either |"android"| or |"ios"|.
  * |rules|: An array of various rules that must be satisfied in order
    to use the configuration. See the Rules <#rules> section below.
  * |dpi|: The DPI of the device's screen, either as a scalar value or
    as an array of X and Y DPI. Get this information via the Device Info
    App
    <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jphilli85.deviceinfo>
    and look for |Actual DPI X| and |Actual DPI Y| values.
  * |bw|: The bezel width in millimeters, with many phones having
    between 3 or 4mm bezel widths. See the Calculating Bezel Width
    <#calculating-bezel-width> section below.
  * |ac|: The accuracy of this entry. This is not currently used in
    webvr-polyfill <https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill>, but may
    in the future, and used to settle discrepencies between device
    reported information versus DPDB data, although this is more for
    Android apps that have may potentially have access to both API
    reporting and DPDB results. Can be one of the following values:
      o |0|: measurements are speculative. Use as fallback only.
      o |500|: measurements are based on the device's self-reported
        values, which is often inaccurate. Unless you're physically
        measuring a device, this is probably the value to use.
      o |1000|: measurements are based on measuring a physical device.


      <#rules>Rules

The |rules| entry is an array of objects, each with one key/value pair,
and matches if /any/ of the rules match the device.


        <#user-agent>User-Agent

The |ua| rule is matched with the device's User-Agent string. It is not
a regular expression, but just a simple substring match. Go to
useragentstring.com <http://useragentstring.com/> and find something
unique that looks like the device's name. Use this if device type is
|"android"|. Keep in mind of other models, where a string for the Nexus
5 could match the Nexus 5X, hence a string like |"Nexus 5 "| (note the
extra space).

  { "ua": "ASUS_Z00AD" }


        <#mdmh>MDMH

The |mdmh| rule matches a device based on manufacturer, device, model,
and hardware, as reported by the device's Android API. This rule is only
applicable to Android devices running native apps, not the web.

  { "mdmh": "asus/*/ASUS_Z00AD/*" }


        <#resolution>Resolution

The |res| rule matches a device based on its exact pixel resolution.
This should normally only be used on iOS devices because there's a 1:1
mapping between exact resolution and phone model.

  { "res": [640, 960] }


      <#calculating-bezel-width>Calculating Bezel Width

You can calculate the exact bezel width using this formula, where
|deviceWidth| is in millimeters, |screen| is the screen's diagonal
length in millimeters, and |ratio| is the screen resolution's |width /
height|:

(deviceWidth - Math.sqrt((screen * screen) / (1 + (1 / (ratio * ratio))))) / 2;


    <#scripts>Scripts

To generate the |dpdb.json| file from the |dpdb-formatted.json| source
file, run this npm <https://npmjs.org/> script from the command line:

npm run build

Or call this Node <https://nodejs.org/> script directly:

node scripts/build.js --write
